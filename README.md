[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## üëã Welcome!

This repository contains a highly intensive, 3-week study plan designed to help someone rapidly learn Microsoft Azure, core DevOps principles and tools, and prepare for interviews, ultimately aiming to secure a DevOps or Cloud-related job.

It was created for an individual with prior technical experience (specifically in Support Engineering with AWS knowledge) but needing to bridge gaps in Azure, modern DevOps practices (like Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC), and interview skills after a career break.

## ü§î Who is This Plan For?

This plan is ideal for individuals who:

*   Are **highly motivated** and can dedicate **approximately 14 hours per day** for 3 weeks.
*   Have some existing technical background but need to **learn Azure and modern DevOps tools quickly**.
*   Are preparing for the **AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification**.
*   Are **actively seeking a job** in Cloud/DevOps roles and need to prepare for technical and behavioral interviews.
*   May have access to a **mentor** for guidance, especially on hands-on projects.
*   Are transitioning from other tech roles (like Support, SysAdmin) into DevOps.

**Even if you don't fit this exact profile, you can adapt the structure, resources, and project ideas to your own pace and goals.**

## üéØ Purpose of the Plan

The primary goal is to provide a structured, actionable roadmap to gain job-ready skills in Azure and DevOps within a very compressed timeframe. It focuses on:

1.  **Fundamental Knowledge:** Building a solid understanding of Azure services, Linux, Networking, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, CI/CD, Scripting, and Monitoring.
2.  **Hands-On Experience:** Emphasizing practical application through labs and real-world project scenarios.
3.  **Certification Preparation:** Aligning learning with the objectives of the AZ-104 exam.
4.  **Interview Readiness:** Dedicating specific time to practice technical concepts and behavioral interview techniques.

## üó∫Ô∏è Structure of the Plan

The core of this repository is the `intensive_devops_study_plan.md` file. It is organized as follows:

1.  **Introduction:** Overview of the plan's goals and assumptions.
2.  **Weekly Breakdown:** High-level goals and focus areas for each of the three weeks.
3.  **Detailed Daily Schedule & Resources:** A day-by-day breakdown (assuming 14 hours/day) outlining specific topics, suggested time allocation, and links to key learning resources (primarily Microsoft Learn, official documentation, and reputable tutorials).
4.  **20 Real-Time DevOps Project Ideas:** A list of diverse, hands-on projects focusing on Azure and related technologies, ranging in complexity.
5.  **Hands-on Practice Methods & Tools:** Recommendations on how to get practical experience using sandboxes, free cloud tiers, local tools, GitHub, and more.

## üöÄ How to Use This Plan

1.  **Read Thoroughly:** Start by reading the entire `intensive_devops_study_plan.md` file to understand the scope and flow.
2.  **Assess Your Situation:** Honestly evaluate how much time you can *realistically* commit daily. While designed for 14 hours, **adapt the schedule** to fit your circumstances. Consistency is more important than hitting the exact hourly target every single day.
3.  **Gather Resources:** Ensure you have access to the necessary tools and platforms mentioned (Azure Free Tier, Docker Desktop, VS Code, etc.). Bookmark the key resource links.
4.  **Follow Daily:** Try to follow the daily schedule, focusing on understanding the concepts before moving on. Use the linked resources.
5.  **Prioritize Hands-On:** Don't just read or watch videos. Actively engage with the Microsoft Learn sandboxes, perform the labs, and **work on the projects**. This is where true learning happens.
6.  **Use Your Mentor:** If you have a mentor, leverage their expertise. Ask questions, discuss project architecture, and get feedback.
7.  **Document Your Projects:** Create GitHub repositories for your projects. Write clear README files for each ‚Äì this builds your portfolio.
8.  **Prepare for Costs:** If using the Azure Free Tier, **be vigilant about monitoring costs**. Set budget alerts in the Azure portal to avoid surprises.
9.  **Focus on Week 3:** Don't neglect the interview preparation in Week 3. Practice technical concepts, behavioral questions (using the STAR method), and refine your resume.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Covered

*   **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure (Core Services, Compute, Storage, Networking, Identity, Monitoring)
*   **Certification:** AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator
*   **DevOps Platform:** Azure DevOps (Boards, Repos, Pipelines, Artifacts)
*   **Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (Concepts & AKS)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub / Azure Repos
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** ARM Templates / Bicep (Introduction), Terraform (Mentioned)
*   **Operating System:** Linux Fundamentals
*   **Scripting:** Shell Scripting (Bash), Python (for automation)
*   **Networking:** Core Concepts (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, Subnetting)
*   **Monitoring & Observability:** Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights

## üí° Important Considerations

*   **Pace Yourself:** This is an *intensive* plan. Listen to your body and mind. Take short breaks regularly. Don't burn out.
*   **Adaptability:** This plan is a template, not a rigid prescription. Adjust it based on your strengths, weaknesses, and learning speed.
*   **Fundamentals First:** Ensure you grasp the fundamentals before tackling complex projects.
*   **Communication Skills:** Remember that technical skills alone aren't enough. Practice explaining concepts clearly (Week 3 focus).
