## 20 Real-Time DevOps Project Ideas (Focus on Azure)

*(These projects range in complexity and cover various tools/concepts. Aim to complete at least 5-7 diverse projects during Weeks 2 & 3, guided by your mentor. Document each project in a dedicated GitHub repository with a clear README.)*

1.  **CI/CD for Web App to App Service:** Build and deploy a simple Node.js/Python/ASP.NET Core web application to Azure App Service using Azure Pipelines (YAML). Include build, test, and deployment stages.
2.  **Containerize App & Push to ACR:** Dockerize the web application from Project 1. Use Azure Pipelines to build the Docker image and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
3.  **Deploy Container to App Service:** Modify the CI/CD pipeline from Project 1/2 to deploy the container image from ACR to Azure App Service for Containers.
4.  **Static Website Hosting & CDN:** Deploy a static website (HTML/CSS/JS) to Azure Blob Storage with static website hosting enabled. Configure Azure CDN for caching and use Azure Pipelines for automated deployment upon code changes.
5.  **IaC for Core Infrastructure (Bicep/ARM):** Use Bicep or ARM Templates to define and deploy a core Azure infrastructure: VNet with subnets, Network Security Groups (NSGs), and a Linux Virtual Machine. Automate the deployment using Azure Pipelines.
6.  **Multi-Container App with Docker Compose & ACI:** Define a multi-container application (e.g., web frontend + backend API + Redis cache) using Docker Compose. Deploy it to Azure Container Instances (ACI) using Azure CLI commands within an Azure Pipeline.
7.  **AKS Cluster Provisioning & Basic Deployment:** Provision a basic Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Bicep/ARM or Terraform. Manually deploy a sample application (e.g., Nginx) using `kubectl apply` with standard Kubernetes manifest files (Deployment, Service).
8.  **CI/CD Pipeline to AKS:** Create an Azure Pipeline that builds a container image (like Project 2), pushes it to ACR, and then deploys/updates the application on the AKS cluster (Project 7) using Kubernetes manifests or Kustomize.
9.  **Azure Monitor VM Alerting:** Configure Azure Monitor to collect metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk) from the VM created in Project 5. Set up alert rules for high CPU utilization (>80%) and low disk space (<10GB), triggering email notifications.
10. **Log Analytics for App Service:** Configure diagnostic settings for the App Service in Project 1/3 to send HTTP logs and application logs to a Log Analytics workspace. Write basic Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to find HTTP 5xx errors or count requests per hour.
11. **Python Script for Azure Resource Tagging:** Write a Python script using the Azure SDK (`azure-identity`, `azure-mgmt-resource`) to find Azure resources (VMs, Storage Accounts) missing mandatory tags (e.g., 'Environment', 'CostCenter') and apply default tags or report them.
12. **Reusable Azure Pipeline YAML Template:** Create a reusable Azure Pipeline YAML template for a common task (e.g., building a specific type of application, running a security scanner like Trivy). Reference this template in multiple application pipelines.
13. **Git Branch Policies & PR Validation:** In Azure Repos (or GitHub), configure branch policies for the `main` branch (require PRs, minimum reviewers, link work items, successful build validation). Set up a PR validation pipeline that runs unit tests and linting.
14. **Helm Chart Deployment to AKS:** Package the application from Project 8 (or a standard application like WordPress) using Helm. Modify the Azure Pipeline to deploy the application to AKS using the Helm CLI or the HelmDeploy task.
15. **VNet Peering & NSG Configuration (IaC):** Use Bicep/ARM/Terraform to create two separate VNets in the same region, peer them, and configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to allow specific traffic (e.g., SSH from a bastion host in VNet1 to VMs in VNet2).
16. **AKS Secret Management with Azure Key Vault:** Store application secrets (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) securely in Azure Key Vault. Configure the AKS cluster with the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver and mount secrets as volumes or environment variables into application pods.
17. **Application Insights Integration & Analysis:** Instrument the web application (Project 1/3) with the Application Insights SDK (server-side and optionally client-side). Use the Azure portal to analyze performance (server response time, request rate), track dependencies, investigate failures using the Application Map, and set up availability tests.
18. **Serverless Event-Driven Processing:** Create an Azure Function (Python/Node.js) triggered by new blobs added to a specific Azure Storage container. The function should process the blob (e.g., read metadata, log content). Deploy the function and related resources (Storage, Function App) using Azure Pipelines and IaC.
19. **Database CI/CD with Schema Migration:** Integrate database schema migration (using tools like Flyway, Liquibase with Maven/Gradle, or EF Core Migrations with .NET CLI) into the CI/CD pipeline for an application that uses Azure SQL Database or Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL. Ensure migrations run automatically during deployment.
20. **Comprehensive Azure Monitor Dashboard:** Create a shared Azure Dashboard that visualizes key metrics and log data from multiple components of a deployed application stack (e.g., AKS node/pod status, App Service requests/errors, Azure SQL DTUs, Load Balancer health) using Azure Monitor data sources.



## Hands-on Practice Methods & Tools

Effective hands-on practice is crucial. Utilize a combination of the following methods and tools:

1.  **Microsoft Learn Sandboxes:** Integrated within many Azure learning modules, these provide temporary, free Azure environments to complete specific exercises without needing your own subscription. Ideal for initial exploration of services.
    *   *Link:* Integrated within https://learn.microsoft.com/
2.  **Azure Free Tier / Pay-As-You-Go with Credits:** Sign up for an Azure free account to get initial credits and access to free services for 12 months. This allows you to build personal projects beyond the sandbox limitations. **Crucially, monitor your usage and set budget alerts to avoid unexpected costs.**
    *   *Link:* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
3.  **Azure DevOps Demo Generator:** This tool can provision a sample Azure DevOps project populated with source code, work items, pipelines, etc., based on various templates (e.g., Parts Unlimited). Excellent for exploring Azure DevOps features in a pre-built environment.
    *   *Link:* https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/
4.  **Local Development Environment:**
    *   **Docker Desktop:** Install Docker Desktop on your local machine to build and run containers locally before pushing to registries.
    *   **Minikube / Kind (Kubernetes in Docker):** Set up a local Kubernetes cluster for testing manifests and Helm charts without needing a cloud provider cluster initially.
    *   **VS Code with Extensions:** Utilize extensions for Docker, Kubernetes, Azure (Resources, Pipelines, Bicep), Python, Shell Scripting for a better development experience.
5.  **GitHub:**
    *   **Version Control:** Use Git rigorously for all your scripts and project code.
    *   **Project Portfolio:** Create a separate repository for each project you complete. Write detailed README.md files explaining the project goal, architecture, tools used, and setup instructions. This serves as your portfolio.
6.  **Open Source Contribution Practice:**
    *   **GitHub Explore / `good-first-issue` label:** Browse GitHub to find projects seeking contributions. Look for issues tagged `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted` which are often suitable for newcomers.
    *   **Focus:** Start with documentation improvements or fixing small bugs to understand the contribution workflow (fork, branch, code, test, PR, review).
7.  **Interactive Shells & CLIs:**
    *   **Azure Cloud Shell:** Access Bash or PowerShell with Azure CLI and other tools pre-installed directly from the Azure portal or shell.azure.com.
    *   **Local Terminal:** Install Azure CLI, `kubectl`, Helm, Docker CLI, Python, Bicep tools locally for direct interaction with Azure and local/remote clusters.
8.  **Mentor Guidance:** Regularly connect with your mentor. Discuss project roadblocks, ask for architectural advice, get feedback on your code/pipelines, and understand real-world best practices.
9.  **AZ-104 Practice Exams:** Utilize reputable practice exam providers (like those mentioned in the daily plan, e.g., Whizlabs, MeasureUp, or official Microsoft assessments if available) to simulate exam conditions and identify weak areas.
